Look forst a noisy image is  extracted ok and then its apassed through a transformer and you get a slightly clear yet still noisy  image . The noisy image result is added to the original noise and this new model is then sent back into the trasgormer this time itll provide a clearer image 

Eventually i suppose the noise is extemely random 

Let us take an exmaple of CLIP - Clip is both a Language model and a vision model .


it basically collarbotes both image and its correpsonding meaning say in a high dimensional soace A mans picture and the man letter vector might be in the same direction in a higher dimensional space 


At a high leavel Diffusion Models are trained to remove noise from a image alright 

Diffusion models are kind of inspired by diffusion process in physics
